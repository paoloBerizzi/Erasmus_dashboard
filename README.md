# Erasmus_dashboard
Assignment for the Visualization course at TU/e Eindhoven University of Technology attended during 2019/2020.
We had to use public datasets to create meaningful and quite complex visualizations. Being both international students, we decided to explore thoroughly data about the Erasmus+ program.
The Erasmus program (EuRopean Community Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) was launched in 1987 and in the first year it brought more than three thousand students abroad.

## Dataset
We combined five yearly datasets from <a href="https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/">EU Open Data Portal </a>. In addition, since both institutions' name and field of study were encoded with a code, we had to merge other two datasets to perform a mapping. Lastly, we also wanted to show some relative proportions and therefore we also added data about the total number of students per different year and different country. (<a href="https://data.un.org/">UN open data</a>).
All the datasets required some cleansing: missing or wrong values were common, as well as typos or different features name for similar dataset. The preprocessing has been mainly done with python or directly with Tableau.

## Project and Report
The interactive Tableau workspace can be explored in Tableau Public through by clicking <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/paolo.berizzi#!/vizhome/erasmus_dashboard/Home_dashboard"><b>here</b></a>. 

All our work, procedure, and conclusions have been reported in the report.pdf file.
